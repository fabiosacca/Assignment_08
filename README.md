# Assignment_08
Documents for Assignment_07 - Foundations of Programming (Python) - Aut'22

In this project I include my Python script and Knowledge Document part of the <b>Assignment n.8 for the Foundation of Programming course</b> with the University of Washington (Autumn, 2022). In this assignment, I have covered the steps needed to create a program 'CD_Inventory.py' from a starter code following other developers instructions and docstring conventiosns.

Thanks for reviewing this project. Any feedback and suggestions to improve the program are appreciated!
